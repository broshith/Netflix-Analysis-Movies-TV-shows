Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis

This project involves analyzing Netflix's movies and TV shows data to gain insights into the content production, distribution, and trends across different countries, genres, and time periods. The dataset is used to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

üìä Project Overview

In this project, I‚Äôve performed an in-depth analysis of Netflix content using the dataset from Kaggle. Key visualizations and insights derived from the dataset provide a better understanding of the trends, genres, countries producing the most content, and changes over time.

üîó Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:

Netflix Shows Dataset (Kaggle)

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

üßë‚Äçüíª Steps Followed

Data Loading:

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values and handled them using .fillna().

Processed columns such as listed_in to extract country/genre information.

Converted the release_year column to numeric values for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Top 10 Countries: Analyzed the top countries producing Netflix content.

Most Common Genres: Identified the top genres available on the platform.

Content Added Per Year: Investigated how Netflix content has grown over time.

Ratings Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of ratings across content.

Missing Data Heatmap: Visualized missing values in the dataset using a heatmap.

Visualizations:

Created Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Heatmaps, and Line Plots to represent data visually.

Insights and Conclusions:

Provided actionable insights such as country rankings in content production, genre popularity, and content growth over the years.

üñºÔ∏è Sample Visualizations

Top 10 Content Producers (Countries):

Identified the countries that produce the most content on Netflix.

üîç Insights

Top Content Producers: The United States is the leading country in terms of Netflix content production, followed by India and the United Kingdom.

Genre Popularity: Drama, Comedy, and Thriller are the most common genres available on Netflix.

Content Growth: Netflix has shown a significant increase in new content after 2015, with more content being added every year.

Ratings Distribution: TV-MA and PG-13 are the most prevalent ratings for Netflix shows and movies.

Content by Type: There is a relatively balanced distribution between Movies and TV Shows, but TV Shows make up a larger portion of the platform's offerings.

üìù Conclusion

This project helped me explore the Netflix dataset thoroughly, providing valuable insights into how Netflix's content is distributed across genres, countries, and time. The visualizations and analysis help in understanding trends and patterns, which can be used to predict future content strategies.
